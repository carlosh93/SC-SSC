The results in this folder correspond to the one presented in the paper. 
When loading the files, you will find a variable with the name 
"bestFnameOA", it corresponds to the best result in term of overall 
accuracy, and its structure is similar to:

'name_la=x1_rho=x2_Nseg=x3_ksize=x4'

name: This is the name of the used dataset.
la:   (x1) This is the value of parameter tau in the paper.
rho:  (x2) This is the value of parameter rho in the paper.
Nseg: (x3) This is the value of parameter E in the paper.
Ksize:(x4) This is the value of parameter K_s in the paper.

In order to reproduce the best-obtained results, the parameters for each 
dataset in file 'run_HS' were manually adjusted.
