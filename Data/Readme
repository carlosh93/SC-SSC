## Datasets

The proposed subspace clustering approach (SC-SSC) was tested on three  well-known and challenging hyperspectral images: Indian Pines, Salinas, and The University of Pavia. These datasets are freely available at:

In addition, we test our method with one multispectral image acquired over the city of Zurich (Switzerland) by the QuickBird satellite. The first work which uses this dataset is:

Volpi, M. & Ferrari, V.; "Semantic segmentation of urban scenes by learning local class interactions", In IEEE CVPR 2015 Workshop "Looking from above: when Earth observation meets vision" (EARTHVISION), 
Boston, USA, 2015. and can be downloaded from:

For convenience, we downloaded all of these datasets and place the .mat files in the subfolder "Full Dataset". In addition, we crop the images to select the regions of interest (ROI) presented in the 
paper and save the resulting files in the subfolder ROI. Please refer to the webpage of each dataset to cite the corresponding work. *We are not the owner of these datasets.*
