The proposed subspace clustering approach (SC-SSC) was tested on three 
well-known and challenging hyperspectral images: Indian Pines, Salinas, and
University of Pavia. These datasets are freely avaialable at

In addition, we test our method with one multispectral image acquired over 
the city of Zurich (Switzerland) by the QuickBird satellite. The first work
which uses this dataset is:

Volpi, M. & Ferrari, V.; "Semantic segmentation of urban scenes by 
learning local class interactions", In IEEE CVPR 2015 Workshop 
"Looking from above: when Earth observation meets vision" (EARTHVISION), 
Boston, USA, 2015.

For the convenience of the reviewers, we download all of these datasets
and place the .mat files in the subfolder "Full Dataset". In addition, we
crop the images to select the regions of interest (ROI) presented in the 
paper and save the resulting files in the subfolder ROI. After the 
revision process, and if the paper is accepted, we will guide the users 
of this code to download the data in the corresponding webpages.
