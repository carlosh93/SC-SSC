The sparse optimization problem in Eq. (5), and Eq. (2) are solved by the 
LASSO version of the LARS algorithm implemented in the SPAMS package. We
also sue the k-means algorithm implemented by VLFeat package. For 
the convenience of the reviewers, we provide an already downloaded and  
compiled SPAMS files (version 2.6) and VLFeat package (version 0.9.21).

Besides, we use the implementation of Algorithm 1 provided by authors in 

C. You, C. Li, D. P. Robinson, & R. Vidal  (2018). Scalable exemplar-based 
subspace clustering on class-imbalanced data. In Proceedings of the 
European Conference on Computer Vision (ECCV) (pp. 67-83).

We also use some functions (bestMap,cnormalize,hungarian,etc) provided by 
the authors of SSC and are freely available at
